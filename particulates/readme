Summary on progress of prepraring particulates system:

1%, 10% are the target systems to start with.

1. Particles based on the desired volume fraction is added to the original solvent system, box volume expanded accordingly.

2. Created coordinate file with highly overlapped particles, see matlab script in the folder

3. Use energy_minimization command attempting to reach equilibrium, but it doesn't appear to work as expected.


*** Key issue to discuss ***

1. How to equalize the system using energy minimization
