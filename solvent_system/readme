Summary on Solvent system:

A. Diffusivity:

	Performed equilibrium simulation on a N=4000 system, at density ~0.75
	DPD/tstat 1.0, friction coefficient 1.0
	Calcualted based on Matlab scripts
	Reasonable value based on Stokes-Einstein estimation.

B. Viscosity:
	Performed non-equilibrium simulations on the same system from the last state of the equilibrium system
	Shear rate ranges from 25e-4 ~ 0.25 ( too fast to be under temp control)
	Viscosity vs. shear rate data looks noisy -- confused on the reason

****** Key issue to discuss *******

1. Why viscosity data noisy and how to fi?
